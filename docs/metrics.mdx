## Basics

### Track the number of clicks per link (URL)

If you add a link to an email, you can see the number of clicks per link (URL) in the Metrics tab.

You can see the recipient's status, number of opens, number of clicks per link (URL), and number of unsubscribes in the Recipients table. You can use this to filter and create a new list to send to other campaigns.
