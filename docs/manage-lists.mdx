## Overview

Learn how to manage your lists with Spread. If you have thousands or even tens of thousands of subscribers who haven't received emails in the past few months, you need to warm up your domain and clean up your list before sending emails. If you send emails to temporary/fake email addresses, you will experience soft/hard bounces. If too many bounces occur, your account may be restricted, blocked, or it may take a long time to restore your domain reputation.



## Important things to remember when importing/adding subscribers

When adding email addresses (subscribers) to Spread, please follow the following:

1. Add only subscribers who have previously given email consent.
2. Add protection devices like Recaptcha, Botpoison, etc. to the email consent form to block bots.
3. (If possible) Use a double opt-in to get email consent from subscribers.
4. Do not send emails to email addresses that have unsubscribed or have bounced.

### Spread automatically manages bounced contacts and subscription status.

If you send all emails (transactional, marketing, product update emails) through Spread, Spread automatically manages bounced contacts and subscription status, so you don't need to manage them separately.

If the bounce rate exceeds 5% of the number of emails sent, Spread automatically stops the campaign and sends an email to you to prevent further damage to your domain reputation.

### Spread flags bounced contacts automatically

Spread automatically checks all subscribers and detects email addresses that are likely to bounce. However, note that it is not 100% accurate, so it cannot prevent bounces 100%.

## Create a list

A list is a list of subscribers you want to send an email campaign to. You can create a new list by clicking **Lists** in the left menu in the Spread app.
